KDM6A_analysis

25 coding region amplicons
Multiplex PCR preamp (three pools of the amplicons) and then used product as template for individual PCR amplicon reactions in Fluidigm Access Array chip.
Fluidigm barcode indexing (CS1 and CS2 adapters)
Sequenced by Illumina MiSeq 150 bp PE
Obtained sample demultiplexed fastq files from Genomics/Bioinformatics core services
For each fastq file reads were trimmed to 120 nt. (length of shortest amplicon [no.1]), corresponding forward and reverse trimmed reads were then merged using PANDAseq 2.11 with default options 
Used NUCLEOTIDE_COUNT_FOR_KDM6A.pl (on each amplicon separately) to make a flat file of counts for all position/nucleotides for all samples.
Used HASH_KDM6A.pl (on each amplicon flat file above) to calculate mean and st.dev. for every position/nucleotide count of all samples and then call SNVs greater than threshold allele frequency.
Cora then manually curated these calls.
